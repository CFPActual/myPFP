# My Public Facing Portfolio: 
Welcome to my portfolio.  I hope you enjoy your stay.

## A5 Summary
Based on my analysis of the coupons dataset, I offer the following conclusions:
Drivers who go to bars more than once a month and are either not widowed with adult passengers or under 30 years old showed significantly higher acceptance rates (near or above 70%) for bar-related coupons. 
In contrast, those who frequently dine at inexpensive restaurants and earn less than $50K accepted at a notably lower rate (below 50%). 
This suggests that lifestyle context (social behavior and age) may be more predictive of coupon acceptance than financial or dining habits alone.


## A5 Rubric

#### Project Organization
- A READMe file with a summary of findings and a link to your Jupyter notebook -->
  - containing a brief nontechnical report that highlights the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons.
- Jupyter notebook with headings and text appropriately formatted
- No unnecessary files
- Directories and files have appropriate names and locations

#### Syntax and Code Quality
- Libraries are imported and aliased correctly
- Code does not contain errors
- No long strings of code output
- Demonstrates competency with pandas
- Demonstrates competency with seaborn
- Comments are used appropriately to explain code
- Variables are sensible

#### This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeVisualizations
- Appropriate plots for categorical and continuous variables are utilized
- Plots contain human readable labels
- Plots contain descriptive titles
- Axes are legible
- Subplots are used when appropriate
- Plots are scaled appropriately for readability

#### Findings
- Clearly stated problem for specific coupon group
- Visualizations that demonstrate exploring differences in those who accepted and rejected the coupon
- Interpretation of descriptive and inferential statistics is correct and concise
- The findings are clearly stated in their own section with actionable items highlighted
- Next steps and recommendations
